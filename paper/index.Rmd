# Introduction

With the growth of R community, many R packages have been developed as research products.
@hornik2012did said that "R packages are the result of scholarly activity and as such constitute scholarly resources which must be clearly identifiable for the respective scientific communities". Majority of the R packages are developed and owned by individual author who has been contributing and sharing their knowledge with the public. It is important to recognise the contribution that these R package developers made to the scientific and academic communities. One of the most important metric for scholarly and scientific research publications is download statistics [@GreeneJosephW2016Wrdi]. Similar to publications, the download statistics is an important part of the metric. @rhub suggests that download counts are a popular way that indicates a package's importance and quality.   


To use the R package download statistics as a metric, it must be accurate to be useful and reliable for any purposes such as grant application. As the number of R package downloads is calculated according to the CRANlog entries, the challenge here is to identify whether it is an actual user behind each entry. 

```{r}
dd_start <- "2012-10-01"
dd_end <- Sys.Date() - 1

is_weekend <- function(date) {
  weekdays(date) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")
}

total_downloads <- cran_downloads(from = dd_start, to = dd_end) %>% 
  mutate(weekend = is_weekend(date)) %>% 
  filter(row_number() <= n()-1)

```

The daily total number of R pakcages downloads from October 2012 to July 2021. It is clear that R packages has become popular with the number of R packages downloaded everyday increasing rapidly. There are two unusual number of R package download spikes happened in 2014 and 2018.

```{r , fig.cap = "The daily total number of R pakcages downloads from October 2012 to July 2021.

total_downloads %>%
  ggplot()  + 
  geom_line(aes(date, count/1000))+
  geom_smooth(aes(date, count/1000),stat = "smooth") +
  ggtitle("Daily number of R pakcages downloads") +

  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```

```{r}
load(here::here("paper/Data/spilk_2014.RData"))


ID_2014 <- spilk_2014 %>%  
  group_by(country,ip_id) %>% 
  count()

pkg_ID_2014 <- spilk_2014 %>%  
  group_by(country,ip_id,package) %>% 
  count()


ido <- max(ID_2014$n)/sum(ID_2014$n)

ID_2014_country <- spilk_2014 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  count() 

ID_2014_country <- ID_2014_country%>% 
  mutate(pre = (n/sum(ID_2014_country$n))*100)
  


```


```{r }
library(rworldmap)

mapDevice('x11')
#join to a coarse resolution map
spdf <- joinCountryData2Map(ID_2014_country, joinCode="ISO2", nameJoinColumn="country")

mapCountryData(spdf, nameColumnToPlot="pre", catMethod="fixedWidth")
```


Figure  shows the daily total number of R packages downloads from October 2012 to November 2021. From the plot, it suggests that there has been an enormous growth of R package downloads overtime. Among the growth of the number of downloads, there are two spikes observed. Zooming in for a closer look at the two spikes, the first one happened on 17th of November 2014. On the 17th of November 2014, `r format(round(ido*100, 2), nsmall = 2)`\% of the R packages downloads are done by the IP address from Indonesia.
