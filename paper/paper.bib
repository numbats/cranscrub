abstract = {R, a software package for statistical computing and graphics, has evolved into the lingua franca of (computational) statistics. One of the cornerstones of R’s success is the decentralized and modularized way of creating software using a multi-tiered development model: The R Development Core Team provides the “base system”, which delivers basic statistical functionality, and many other developers contribute code in the form of extensions in a standardized format via so-called packages. In order to be accessible by a broader audience, packages are made available via standardized source code repositories. To support such a loosely coupled development model, repositories should be able to verify that the provided packages meet certain formal quality criteria and “work”: both relative to the development of the base R system as well as with other packages (interoperability). However, established quality assurance systems and collaborative infrastructures typically face several challenges, some of which we will discuss in this paper.},

With this analysis, we provide a deeper insight into the extent and the evolution of the R package ecosystem.},

abstract = {Although recording of usage data is common in scholarly information services, its exploitation for the creation of value-added services remains limited due to concerns regarding, among others, user privacy, data validity, and the lack of accepted standards for the representation, sharing and aggregation of usage data. This paper presents a technical, standards-based architecture for sharing usage information, which we have designed and implemented. In this architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information service. This paper also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed approach, and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of linking servers at the California State University system over a 20 month period.},

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact and techniques for mitigating the effects of web robots on usage statistics collected by Open Access (OA) institutional repositories (IRs).
Design/methodology/approach
A close review of the literature provides a comprehensive list of web robot detection techniques. Reviews of system documentation and open source code are carried out along with personal interviews to provide a comparison of the robot detection techniques used in the major IR platforms. An empirical test based on a simple random sample of downloads with 96.20 per cent certainty is undertaken to measure the accuracy of an IR’s web robot detection at a large Irish University.
Findings
While web robot detection is not ignored in IRs, there are areas where the two main systems could be improved. The technique tested here is found to have successfully detected 94.18 per cent of web robots visiting the site over a two-year period (recall), with a precision of 98.92 per cent. Due to the high level of robot activity in repositories, correctly labelling more robots has an exponential effect on the accuracy of usage statistics.
Research limitations/implications
This study is performed on one repository using a single system. Future studies across multiple sites and platforms are needed to determine the accuracy of web robot detection in OA repositories generally.
Originality/value
This is the only study to date to have investigated web robot detection in IRs. It puts forward the first empirical benchmarking of accuracy in IR usage statistics.},

abstract = {The use of citation counts to assess the impact of research articles is well established. However, the citation impact of an article can only be measured several years after it has been published. As research articles are increasingly accessed through the Web, the number of times an article is downloaded can be instantly recorded and counted. One would expect the number of times an article is read to be related both to the number of times it is cited and to how old the article is. The authors analyze how short‐term Web usage impact predicts medium‐term citation impact. The physics e‐print archive—arXiv.org—is used to test this.},
