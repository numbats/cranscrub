abstract = {R, a software package for statistical computing and graphics, has evolved into the lingua franca of (computational) statistics. One of the cornerstones of R’s success is the decentralized and modularized way of creating software using a multi-tiered development model: The R Development Core Team provides the “base system”, which delivers basic statistical functionality, and many other developers contribute code in the form of extensions in a standardized format via so-called packages. In order to be accessible by a broader audience, packages are made available via standardized source code repositories. To support such a loosely coupled development model, repositories should be able to verify that the provided packages meet certain formal quality criteria and “work”: both relative to the development of the base R system as well as with other packages (interoperability). However, established quality assurance systems and collaborative infrastructures typically face several challenges, some of which we will discuss in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper explores the ecosystem of software packages for R, one of the most popular environments for statistical computing today. We empirically study how R packages are developed and distributed on different repositories: CRAN, BioConductor, R-Forge and GitHub. We also explore the role and size of each repository, the inter-repository dependencies, and how these repositories grow over time. With this analysis, we provide a deeper insight into the extent and the evolution of the R package ecosystem.},
